#Circlelator - A Python script to calculate values of a circle

Circlelator is a small script without GUI that allows you to calculate values of a circle with one value given.

circlelator is released under BSD 3.0 license. See LICENSE.txt for details. 

##Run the script:
To run the script you have to use the console and run the following command in the Circlelator directory.

```python circlelator.py```

The console will ask you which value of the circle is given and how much it is. The script will calculate the rest automatically. 

##System requirements
The only thing you need to use Circlelator is a working Python installation. I tested the script with version 2.7.3 and I didn't have any problems. (Run ```python``` on the console to find your version)

##What do I type in?

* If radius is given: Type in ```r``` or ```radius``` and the value 

__Example:__

			What do you know about the circle? radius
			How much is radius? 3

* If diameter is given: Type in ```d``` or ```diameter``` and the value

__Example:__

			What do you know about the circle? d
			How much is d? 15


* If circumference is given: Type in ```c``` or ```circumference``` and the value

* If area is given: Type in ```a``` or ```area``` and the value
